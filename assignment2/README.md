# Plotting Figures

The original exercise instructions say to save data a space-delimited format, such as in the example `test.data` file, but I would rather save the logs themselves so that they have the correct labels/units. These logs can be found in the folder `raw-data`.

The graphs were plotted by modifying parameters in `plot.py`. This was kind of scuffed tbh.
The parameters that were modified are: 
- filename - name of the data file.
- label – label to be used in the legend, e.g., “iperf2” or “iperf3”. 
- xlabel – x-axis label 
- ylabel – y-axis label 
- title – title of the plotted graph 
- fig\_name – name of the saved file
